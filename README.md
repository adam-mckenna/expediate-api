# Expediate: a simple way to log your DQS

Expediate is a simple way for athletes to track their [Diet Quality Score](https://strengthrunning.com/2014/06/runners-diet-plan-matt-fitzgerald-interview/).

Matt Fitzgerald introduced the DQS system in his book, [Racing Weight](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7192581-racing-weight). The system aims to give athletes a rule-of-thumb way to measure the quality of their diets without tracking every calorie.

This app (ideally) makes it even easier: just dump everything you ate into a text field and let Expediate do the rest.
